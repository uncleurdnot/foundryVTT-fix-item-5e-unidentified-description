# foundryVTT-fix-item-5e-unidentified-description
Patches a bug that causes items to display their descriptions in DnD 5e v 3.3.1
This should be fixed in version 4.0.x, but that will require Foundy V12, which doesn't support all of my modules.  Uploaded in case this is useful for anyone else.

## Installation
In the setup screen, use the manifest URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uncleurdnot/foundryVTT-fix-item-5e-unidentified-description/master/module.json to install the module.
